# Contributing to the Claude Code Subagents Collection

We welcome contributions from the community. If you would like to contribute to the project, please follow the guidelines below.

## Adding New Agents

To contribute a new subagent to the collection:

1.  **Follow Naming Convention**
    *   Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names (e.g., `backend-architect.md`)
    *   Name should clearly indicate the agent's domain and role

2.  **Use Standard Format**
    *   Include proper frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and optional `tools`, `model`
    *   Follow the structured format outlined in the [Subagent Format](README.md#-subagent-format) section of the `README.md` file.

3.  **Write Clear Descriptions**
    *   Description should clearly indicate when the agent should be automatically invoked
    *   Include specific keywords and contexts that trigger the agent

4.  **Define Specialized Behavior**
    *   Include detailed system prompt with role, expertise, and capabilities
    *   Define interaction patterns with other agents
    *   Specify decision-making frameworks and priorities

5.  **Test Integration**
    *   Verify the agent can be automatically invoked based on description
    *   Test explicit invocation with clear requests
    *   Ensure compatibility with existing agent coordination patterns

### Quality Standards

*   **Domain Expertise**: Agents should demonstrate deep knowledge in their specialization
*   **Clear Boundaries**: Define what the agent does and doesn't handle
*   **Integration Ready**: Design for seamless coordination with other agents
*   **Consistent Voice**: Maintain professional, helpful, and expert tone

### Submission Process

1.  Create the agent file following all standards
2.  Test the agent with various invocation patterns
3.  Submit a pull request with example use cases
4.  Include documentation of the agent's unique value and integration patterns
