## üì¶ Installation

### Quick Setup

These subagents are automatically available when placed in the `~/.claude/agents/` directory. Claude Code will automatically detect and load them on startup.

```bash
# Clone the repository to your Claude agents directory
# Documents are base on the scaffold from https://github.com/wshobson/agents.git
cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/lst97/claude-code-sub-agents.git

# Or if the directory already exists, pull the latest updates
cd ~/.claude/agents
git pull origin main
```

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can manually copy individual agent files:

```bash
# Copy specific agents to your Claude agents directory
cp /path/to/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Verification

To verify agents are loaded correctly:

```bash
# List all available agents
ls ~/.claude/agents/*.md

# Check Claude Code recognizes the agents (run in Claude Code)
# "List all available subagents"
```

### üé≠ Advanced: Agent-Organizer Auto-Dispatch Setup

For complex projects requiring multi-agent coordination, you can enable the dispatch protocol in your **project root directory** (not globally):

```bash
# Copy CLAUDE.md to your PROJECT root directory (recommended)
cp /path/to/agents/CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Project-Scope Recommendation:**

- **‚úÖ Project-Specific**: Place CLAUDE.md in individual project roots for targeted orchestration
- **‚ùå Global Scope**: Avoid placing in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to prevent over-orchestration of simple tasks
- **üéØ Selective Usage**: Enable only for projects requiring comprehensive multi-agent workflows

**Trade-offs to Consider:**

- **Quality vs Speed**: Multi-agent workflows provide expert results but take longer
- **Token Efficiency**: 2-5x token usage for comprehensive analysis and implementation
- **Complexity Matching**: Best for complex projects, may over-engineer simple tasks

## üîß Usage

### Automatic Invocation (Recommended)

Claude Code intelligently analyzes your request and automatically delegates to the most appropriate subagent(s) based on:

- **Context Analysis**: Keywords, file types, and project structure
- **Task Classification**: Development, debugging, optimization, etc.
- **Domain Expertise**: Matching requirements to specialist knowledge
- **Workflow Patterns**: Common multi-agent coordination scenarios

**Example**: `"Implement user authentication with secure password handling"` ‚Üí Automatically uses: `backend-architect` ‚Üí `security-auditor` ‚Üí `test-automator`

### Explicit Invocation

For specific expertise or when you want control over agent selection:

```bash
# Direct agent requests
"Use the code-reviewer to check my recent changes"
"Have the security-auditor scan for vulnerabilities"
"Get the performance-engineer to optimize this bottleneck"

# Multi-agent requests
"Have backend-architect design the API, then security-auditor review it"
"Use data-scientist to analyze this dataset, then ai-engineer to build recommendations"
```

### Hybrid Approach

Combine automatic and explicit invocation:

```bash
# Start explicit, let Claude coordinate the rest
"Use backend-architect to design a REST API for user management, then handle the implementation automatically"

# Explicit validation after automatic work
"Implement this feature automatically, then have security-auditor review the result"
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Direct Agent Invocation

```bash
# Single specialist tasks
"Use code-reviewer to analyze this component"
"Have security-auditor check for vulnerabilities"
"Get backend-architect to design user authentication"

# Multi-agent workflows (automatic coordination)
"Implement payment processing"  # ‚Üí payment-integration ‚Üí security-auditor
"Optimize database performance"  # ‚Üí database-optimizer ‚Üí performance-engineer
"Build responsive dashboard"     # ‚Üí frontend-developer ‚Üí test-automator
```

## üìã Subagent Format

Each subagent follows a standardized structure for consistent behavior and optimal integration:

### File Structure

```markdown
---
name: subagent-name
description: When this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2  # Optional - defaults to all tools
---

# Subagent Name

**Role**: Detailed role description and primary responsibilities

**Expertise**: Specific technologies, frameworks, and domain knowledge

**Key Capabilities**:
- Capability 1: Description
- Capability 2: Description
- Capability 3: Description

System prompt defining the subagent's specialized behavior, decision-making patterns, and interaction style with other agents.
```

### Required Components

- **Name**: Kebab-case filename matching the agent name
- **Description**: Clear trigger conditions for automatic invocation
- **Role Definition**: Specific responsibilities and boundaries
- **Expertise Areas**: Technologies, patterns, and domain knowledge
- **System Prompt**: Detailed instructions for specialized behavior

### Optional Components

- **Tools**: Specific Claude Code tools (defaults to all available tools)
- **Dependencies**: Other agents this one commonly works with
- **Patterns**: Common workflow patterns and coordination scenarios

## üîÑ Agent Orchestration Patterns

Claude Code automatically coordinates agents using these patterns:

- **Sequential**: `architect ‚Üí implement ‚Üí test ‚Üí review` for dependent tasks
- **Parallel**: `performance-engineer + database-optimizer` for independent analysis  
- **Validation**: `primary-agent ‚Üí security-auditor` for critical components
- **Iterative**: `review ‚Üí refine ‚Üí validate` for optimization tasks

## ü§ù Contributing

### Adding New Agents

To contribute a new subagent to the collection:

1. **Follow Naming Convention**
   - Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names (e.g., `backend-architect.md`)
   - Name should clearly indicate the agent's domain and role

2. **Use Standard Format**
   - Include proper frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and optional `tools`
   - Follow the structured format outlined in the [Subagent Format](#-subagent-format) section

3. **Write Clear Descriptions**
   - Description should clearly indicate when the agent should be automatically invoked
   - Include specific keywords and contexts that trigger the agent

4. **Define Specialized Behavior**
   - Include detailed system prompt with role, expertise, and capabilities
   - Define interaction patterns with other agents
   - Specify decision-making frameworks and priorities

5. **Test Integration**
   - Verify the agent can be automatically invoked based on description
   - Test explicit invocation with clear requests
   - Ensure compatibility with existing agent coordination patterns

### Quality Standards

- **Domain Expertise**: Agents should demonstrate deep knowledge in their specialization
- **Clear Boundaries**: Define what the agent does and doesn't handle
- **Integration Ready**: Design for seamless coordination with other agents
- **Consistent Voice**: Maintain professional, helpful, and expert tone

### Submission Process

1. Create the agent file following all standards
2. Test the agent with various invocation patterns
3. Submit a pull request with example use cases
4. Include documentation of the agent's unique value and integration patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
