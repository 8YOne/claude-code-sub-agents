## üì¶ Installation

### Quick Setup

These subagents are automatically available when placed in the `~/.claude/agents/` directory. Claude Code will automatically detect and load them on startup.

```bash
# Clone the repository to your Claude agents directory
# Documents are base on the scaffold from https://github.com/wshobson/agents.git
cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/lst97/claude-code-sub-agents.git

# Or if the directory already exists, pull the latest updates
cd ~/.claude/agents
git pull origin main
```

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can manually copy individual agent files:

```bash
# Copy specific agents to your Claude agents directory
cp /path/to/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Verification

To verify agents are loaded correctly:

```bash
# List all available agents
ls ~/.claude/agents/*.md

# Check Claude Code recognizes the agents (run in Claude Code)
# "List all available subagents"
```

### üé≠ Advanced: Agent-Organizer Auto-Dispatch Setup

For users who want Claude Code to automatically use the agent-organizer for most complex tasks, you can enable the dispatch protocol:

```bash
# Copy the CLAUDE.md dispatch protocol to your Claude config directory
cp /path/to/agents/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings:**

- **üîÑ Auto-Orchestration**: With CLAUDE.md enabled, Claude Code will automatically invoke the agent-organizer for most non-trivial tasks
- **üí∞ Token Usage**: Multi-agent workflows consume significantly more tokens than single-agent responses (2-5x increase typical)
- **‚è±Ô∏è Processing Time**: Orchestrated workflows take longer to complete due to multi-step agent coordination
- **üéØ Precision vs Speed**: While results are more comprehensive and expert-driven, simple tasks may be over-engineered

**When CLAUDE.md is Active:**

- ‚úÖ Complex projects get expert multi-agent analysis and implementation
- ‚úÖ Quality is higher due to specialized agent expertise and validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Simple questions may trigger unnecessary agent orchestration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Token costs increase substantially for routine tasks

**Recommended For:**

- Users who prioritize quality and thoroughness over speed and token efficiency

**Not Recommended For:**

- Casual coding assistance or simple questions
- Token-sensitive environments or usage limits
- Quick prototyping or experimental work

## üîß Usage

### Automatic Invocation (Recommended)

Claude Code intelligently analyzes your request and automatically delegates to the most appropriate subagent(s) based on:

- **Context Analysis**: Keywords, file types, and project structure
- **Task Classification**: Development, debugging, optimization, etc.
- **Domain Expertise**: Matching requirements to specialist knowledge
- **Workflow Patterns**: Common multi-agent coordination scenarios

**Example**: `"Implement user authentication with secure password handling"` ‚Üí Automatically uses: `backend-architect` ‚Üí `security-auditor` ‚Üí `test-automator`

### Explicit Invocation

For specific expertise or when you want control over agent selection:

```bash
# Direct agent requests
"Use the code-reviewer to check my recent changes"
"Have the security-auditor scan for vulnerabilities"
"Get the performance-engineer to optimize this bottleneck"

# Multi-agent requests
"Have backend-architect design the API, then security-auditor review it"
"Use data-scientist to analyze this dataset, then ai-engineer to build recommendations"
```

### Hybrid Approach

Combine automatic and explicit invocation:

```bash
# Start explicit, let Claude coordinate the rest
"Use backend-architect to design a REST API for user management, then handle the implementation automatically"

# Explicit validation after automatic work
"Implement this feature automatically, then have security-auditor review the result"
```
